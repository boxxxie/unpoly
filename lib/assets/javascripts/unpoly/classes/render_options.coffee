  # Generally we have decided to share:
  #
  # - Options that are relevant before the request is sent (e.g. { url } or { solo }).
  # - Options that change how we think about the entire rendering operation.
  #   E.g. if we always want to see a server response, we set { fallback: true }.
  #
  # Generally we have decided to not share:
  #
  # - Layer-related options (e.g. target layer or options for a new layer)
  # - Options that change focus. The user might focus a specific element from a success element,
  #   like { focus: '.result', failFocus: '.errors' }.
  # - Options that change focus. The user might scroll to a specific element from a success element,
  #   like { reveal: '.result', failReaveal: '.errors' }.
